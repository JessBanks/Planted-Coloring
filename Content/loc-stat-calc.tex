\section{Local Statistics in the Planted Model}
In this section, $\bG$ is a random graph on vertex set $[n]$.  Each vertex is assigned labeled in $[k]$; in particular the first $\pi(1)n$ vertices are assigned label $1$, the next $\pi(2)n$ vertices are assigned label $2$ and so on.  Given a graph $H$ on constant number of vertices along with a distinguished subset of vertices $S$ and a labeling o
